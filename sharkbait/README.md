# 🦈 Agent Sharkbait

> "Shark bait, ooh ha ha!" — The Tank Gang

A code review agent that roams the repo like a shark through the ocean. Every file gets an ocean-themed review, a rating on the **Sharkbait Scale™**, commentary from the Tank Gang, and unsolicited nautical wisdom.

**No APIs. No dependencies. No mercy. Just sharks.**
